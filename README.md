# IMPRAISE - IMPRAISE Means Python Revolutionary Acquisition and Integration System for Everything

## Overview 🌟

Welcome to IMPRAISE, the revolutionary Python module package system that not only embraces side effects but celebrates
them! Here, we believe that every side effect is a hidden feature waiting to be discovered. 🎉

## Features 🚀

- **Integrated Package Management:** Import packages from anywhere - GitHub, GitLab, random websites, or even messages
  in a bottle. 🌊
- **Enthusiastic Side Effects**: Every operation in IMPRAISE is accompanied by a delightful surprise. Side effects are 
  not bugs, they are undocumented features! 🐞🎁
- **Revolutionary Import System:** We've reinvented the wheel because we believe squares can roll too. Expect the
  unexpected. 🛸

## Installation 📦

Simply run:

```bash
pip install impraise
```

*If this doesn't work, try shouting at your computer in Python. It understands passion. 📣*

## Usage 📚

This is a simple example that imports a greet_person function from the wizard and greets a person. The greeting is
randomized, so you never know what you're going to get! 🎲

```python
# noinspection PyUnresolvedReferences
import src.impraise.main
import a_function_that_takes_a_name_and_an_age_as_input_that_is_42_if_not_given_and_greets_the_person_and_says_their_age_Make_the_greeting_text_random_but_do_not_add_a_basic_random_number_to_the_text_Choose_between_at_least_ten_greetings_and_sentence_structures_in_each_function_call_Remember_what_you_have_chosen_between_the_function_calls_and_cycle_through_the_options_at_each_new_call_The_function_should_be_called_greet_person_Use_the_globals_function_to_save_this_state as wizard

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(wizard.greet_person('John'))
    print(wizard.greet_person('John', age=23))
```
